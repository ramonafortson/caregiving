== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's with the name changing from Tipsy Social Icons to WP Social Icons back to Tipsy Social Icons? =

When I first began working on this plugin, it was called Tipsy Social Icons because of some of the JavaScript effects that it was using. When I launched a premium version of the plugin, I named it WP Social Icons. In order to keep the branding consistent, I attempted to label this one as the 'Lite' or the 'Free' version.

Over time, there's been little impact in doing attempting to keep the names the same, so I've opted to continue working on this version as Tipsy Social Icons.

= Do you take feature requests? =

Yes! You can email me at tom[at]tommcfarlin[dot]com

= May I donate to this plugin? =
